A simple 5-day weather forecast webapp using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). Users can input a city and find the 5-day weather forecast for that city.

## About Code

This webapp uses specifically the [5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast API](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) which gives weather information of a city for 5 days in 3 hour increments. I had to filter out data to only pick the data for a specified time across 5 days in order to generate the forecast.
